# PowerBI-dashboard-hospitality-
This is Power Bi Project based on hopitality data set and it is going to help the hotal understand its business growth.

Performance Measurement and Analysis:

KPIs(Key Performance Indicators)

DAX(Data Analysis Expressions)

Metrics(metrics and measurement techniques)

In this project,I did use power querry for cleaning the data then I used data modeling for making relationship which was star scheema(In which the fact table is at the center, and dimension tables radiate out from it, creating a star-like pattern),then i used some DAX function according to my data requirement after that i created matrics and kPIs.
